Hello!
As the date of the Festival draws near, we're looking to finalize our print media, such as our programs, and the digital guide. According to our records, from you we're missing a logo and banner. Please send them to me (austin@bostonfig.com) at your earliest convenience. We need all of your assets by Monday, September 1.

If you have any questions or concerns, we'd be more than happy to work with you.

Thanks once again for your sponsorship, and we look forward to seeing you at the Festival!
