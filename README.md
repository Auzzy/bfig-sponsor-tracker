A website written for BFIG to track gathering of assets from sponsors. It grew in scope due to demand to also track sales progress.

I set a challenge for myself to do this without using jQuery. Why? It was interesting.

As you can tell if you spin up the site, it's not very good. In part, it's because of that scope creep. Also, that I didn't use jQuery or any related technologies. But probably most of all, I'm not a webdev. I've learned a lot about web dev both throught his project and since.
